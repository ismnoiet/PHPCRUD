# PHPCRUD
***Salam***,
AutoCRUD is a set of simple classes to generate all the basic operations when connecting to a database

and the result will be a php file containg all those methods.

The idea behind all of this is  to be able find,insert,modify,delete records from database just by providing 
the table structure
